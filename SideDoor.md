## College
A degree is not ncessary to break into IT, but it **will** open doors.  Many companies have a separate budget for new college hires, which increases your chances of being hired, and those new recruits often go through rotations in different departments.  Pairing an internship with real-world experience will put you at the top of the list.

You should be ready for an entry-level position after getting an intermediate-level certification with Linux and Python.  It will be helpful to have a public github with your projects - this can help establish your credibility beyond the certifications.  It took me 6-9 months to get to the point where I was comfortable interviewing for sysadmin jobs.

## Informal Learning Path
Focus on things that are not necessarily taught in college, like system administration, container orchestration, networking, security principles, etc.  Most of your peers will not have these skills.

1. Platform (Linux/Windows)\
Learn the fundamentals of operating system administration, and how it gets used (particularly for server use cases).  Linux will be more broadly applicable.  

1. Platform Automation (Python/Powershell)\
Learn these automation tools from the perspective of automating the administration of the platform (windows or linux) that you are learning.  When you're practicing, think about how you'd update a machine automatically, or a group of machines.

1. Containers (Docker)\
This is a lighter topic, and your Linux course will probably have touched on it.  It is how almost all modern software applications are packaged, so it is important to know it well.  It will tie in very nicely with your Python learning

1. Orchestration (Kubernetes)\
With a solid understanding of containers, you should be able to tackle this.  It deals with how you manage the deployment of containers across machines.  Its a very deep topic, but in very very high demand across all industries.  

1. Cloud (Azure/AWS/Google)\
Clouds are where a lot of workloards are run, and while all of them do the same stuff, they are operated bit differently.  Once you have a solid understanding of the previous topics, picking up these cloud-specific nuances should be easy, but will take time.

## Certifications
You may want to look through some job postings to see which certifications are most desired (RedHat might be more popular).  This set of certs should help open the door to a solid SRE gig.
